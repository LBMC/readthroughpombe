\section{Data pre-processing}

Data were sequenced on 1 lane on the same flowcell with an Illumina Hiseq platform 50-read length single-end in IGBMC (S17017 project). This was RNA seq experiments using a Ribozero kit depletion.\\
Each strain was sequenced in triplicates: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item WT: samples 1, 6, 11
  \item cut14-208 mutant: samples 2, 7, 12
  \item rrp6D mutant: samples 5, 10, 15
  \item cut14-208/cdc15-118 double mutant: samples 3, 8, 13
  \item cdc15-118 mutant: samples 4, 9, 14
\end{itemize}

Samples from 59,340,962 to 93,363,639 reads after adapters removal were provided. 
The encoding of quality values is Sanger / Illumina 1.9 format.\\
See doc directory for reports produced by IGBMC. 

% ----------------
\subsection{FastQC}

\begin{itemize}
  \item adapter trimming. This was performed by IGBMC and not done, indeed there is no contamination in adapter as regards FASTQ reports. 
  \item quality of sequencing. It is good quality data as regards mean(QPhred)>30 whathever the position within the read on both ends. There is potential high level of library duplication for some samples (presence of observations in the last duplicate bin plot).
  \item bp content. First 12 bp are biased in bp content probably due to experimental protocole (random hexamer fixation on RNA fragments), this does not required trimming. 3 samples (cut14 repl1, rrp6D repl3 and cdc15 repl1) display, as raw data and after trimming, 2 modes in GC\% distribution; this reflects rRNA sequences after some BLAST attempts. Indeed according to https://www.pombase.org/status/statistics, rRNA contains 48\% of GC compared to protein coding genes (36\%). This could also reflects tRNA content (54\% of GC). These 3 samples also display a high content of overrepresented sequences. Note that cdc15 repl2 also displays a high content of overrepresented sequences.  
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data cleaning}

We used cutadapt to trim tails with quality lower than 20. No other filter was applied.

\section{DESeq2 analysis}

In presence of condensine defects, 2 phenotypes are observed: 1) an overexpression of genes and 2) readthrough for some genes. 4 mutants are used to study direct and indirect effects of condensine defects (+ a WT strain):
\begin{itemize}
  \item cut14: condensine faulty
  \item cdc15: no cytokinesis 
  \item cdc15-cut14: double mutant, no daughter cell
  \item rrp6
\end{itemize}

Several analysis need to be done:
\begin{itemize}
  \item cut14-208 vs wt: phenotype 1 observed
  \item cdc15-118 vs wt: no more phenotype 1 observed: cdc15 suppresses effects of cut14.
  \item cut14-208\_cdc15-118 vs wt: no more phenotype 1 observed: cdc15 suppresses effects of cut14.
  \item cut14-208\_cdc15-118 vs cut14-208 / cut14-208\_cdc15-118 vs cdc15-118: should be equivalent if cdc15 suppresses effect of cut14.
  \item rrp6D vs wt
  \item rrp6D vs cut14-208
\end{itemize}

Each time, conditions are in triplicates. Annotation is saved in \texttt{/data/2017\_10\_03\_annotation.csv}.\\
Detailed results were saved in \texttt{results/DESeq2\_analysis/}. Within each results directory, a CSV file indicates outputs for all genes ordererd by increasing adjusted p-val value, so called \texttt{deseq2\_shrinked\_analysis\_cut14-208\_cdc15-118\_vs\_cut14-208.csv} for the analysis of the double mutant vs cut14 for instance.

\section{Meeting 09.26.2017}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Validate on what we work for RNASeq\\
  \textcolor{green}{Annotations from PomBase for ncRNA\_gene, pseudogene, gene, snoRNA\_gene, snRNA\_gene on chromosomes I, II and III. The gff used is located in \texttt{data/2017\_10\_03\_selected\_features\_s\_pombe.gff}. The gff used for tRNAs is in \texttt{data/2017\_10\_03\_tRNAs\_s\_pombe.gff}.} Note that inputs for RSEM must be in gtf2 format.

  \item Do RNASeq analysis with adding missing replicates.\\
  \textcolor{green}{This was done on 2017.10.03.}
  
  \item Validate comparisons to be done with rrp6 mutant.\\
  \textcolor{green}{Venn diagrams will be done by Clemence Hocquet and Pascal Bernard. }
  
  \item Validate figures of density of up-regulated genes.\\
  \textcolor{green}{Density of up/down and equally expressed genes were plotted.}

  \item Validate distance between genes and tRNA + reformulate questions as regards the test wanted.\\
    \textcolor{green}{A KS unilateral test as well as a GLM quasi Poisson were done and pvalues were reported on plots.}

  \item Readthrough: now we have the expressiong per gene, need to compute gene by gene profiles with different sizes of windows. 
  
\end{itemize}
